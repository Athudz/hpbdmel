            <p>Ehe=))) just kidding. But congratulations for living on Earth for 15 years! I don't know how to make cards, so I just coded the website even though i havent been skillful yet. No matter what, I hope you always do what you want, follow your dream and find true love. I know it's very difficult because what you've been through makes you quite sensitive, but I believe you will get over it.
            </p>
            <p>Just like you, I'm afraid I won't have any more relationships with you, Ngan, Nguyet, Hanh, Mai, to 2 and everyone else. We probably won't be close anymore because we go to different schools and it's so fucking horrible. I love you guys and don't want to lose you. But even so, I hope we can pass this entrance exam together. I believe you can do it, and let's try together.I wish we are friends in every universes</p>

            <p>Anyway, I hate guys who talk too much and are arrogant and flexible. But it's different with you, thank you for being my friend and helping me go through all the difficulties. I feel very grateful to you because you also hate people like me and understand me better than anyone. If my life were a song, you would be one of the highest notes. Thank you for coming into my life.

              </p>
             <p>  Let's live this 15th year happily!</p>
